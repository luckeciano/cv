about: '\vspace{18pt} \small{
    I am a professional with a mixed background in research and engineering. In recent years, my main work applied Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning algorithms for real-world scenarios at scale. My research curiosity is to \textbf{develop agents that learn behaviors through interaction, in an efficient, generalist, and adaptive way}. I believe these agents emerge from \textbf{representation learning}, \textbf{world models}, and \textbf{intrinsically-motivated decision-making}. This motivates me to work in the intersection of (Model-Based) Reinforcement Learning, Probabilistic Modeling, and Foundation Models.
